# HCM_diagnostic_models
The first file contains a Python notebook which shows the preprocessing steps and subsequent model creation of a convolutional neural network built using Keras for the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common genetic heart diseases, that uses cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images.  It uses CMR scans collected from Omid Hospital in Tehran, Iran and published in the Kaggle Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy dataset.  
The second file is a second Python notebook that shows the preprocessing steps and model creation of an LSTM network that can be used to diagnose HCM using electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) data.  It uses EKG data collected from the Kaggle page for the PTB-XL ECG Dataset collected at the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) research institute in Brunswick, Germany.
