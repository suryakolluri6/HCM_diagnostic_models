# HCM_diagnostic_models
# The first file contains a Python notebook which shows the preprocessing steps and subsequent model creation of a convolutional neural network built using Keras for the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common genetic heart diseases, that uses cardiac magnetic resonance images.
# The second file is a second Python notebook that shows the preprocessing steps and model creation of an LSTM network that can be used to diagnose HCM using EKG data.
